      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Online Ramsey games we have two players.&#xA;One is placing edges to a graph with infinite number of vertices while the second chooses their color to be blue or red immediately.&#xA;Builder (the first player) aims to force a monochromatic graph to appear.&#xA;Painter (the second player) tries to postpone win of the first player as long as possible.&#xA;Due to Ramsey theorem, we know that the first player eventually wins.&#xA;Our aim is to analyze the game to determine the minimum number of rounds necessary for the first player win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Computing m-Eternal Domination Number of Cactus Graphs in Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2023/cacti_eternal_domination/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is a culmination of a long-term effort of me and Matyáš under the supervision of Tomáš.&#xA;It was initiated by Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis of Matyáš which then turned into &lt;a href=&#34;../../2019/cacti_eternal_domination/&#34;&gt;a published paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reserach concerns m-eternal domination &amp;ndash; a setting where two players, attacked and defender, play in turns.&#xA;One designs the initial layout of $k$ guards on the input graph and tells how they are all moved.&#xA;Each turn the attacked announces a vertex and the defender can move all guards, each by at most one edge, so that the attacked vertex now contains a guard.&#xA;Clearly, this game played in only one turn is equivalent to the dominating set.&#xA;The tricky part is that we play virtually infinite number of rounds and if there is a strategy of an attacker to force an undefended vertex, then he wins.&#xA;For example, paths require N/2 guards while only N/3 is its domination number.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient attack sequences in m-eternal domination</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2022/edn-attack-sequences/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are given a graph and a number of guards to defend it against a sequence of vertex attacks.&#xA;Defender controls the guards and may move every guard by at most one edge after each attack.&#xA;After his move the attacked vertex must be occupied by a guard, otherwise the attacked wins.&#xA;Defender wins if he has a strategy that defends the graph indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We investigate this problem for trees where the optimal strategy was already known.&#xA;However, if the defender has insufficient number of guards, then how can we attack efficiently?&#xA;We analyze the worst case where the defender is missing a single guard to be able to defend indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bears with Hats and Independence Polynomials</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following hat guessing game.&#xA;A bear sits on each vertex of a graph $G$, and a demon puts on each bear a hat colored by one of $h$ colors.&#xA;Each bear sees only the hat colors of his neighbors.&#xA;Based on this information only, each bear has to guess $g$ colors and he guesses correctly if his hat color is included in his guesses.&#xA;The bears win if at least one bear guesses correctly for any hat arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the m-eternal Domination Number of Cactus Graphs</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2019/cacti_eternal_domination/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research is a followup to Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Thesis of Jan Matyáš Křišťan &lt;a href=&#34;https://alfresco.fit.cvut.cz/share/proxy/alfresco/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/30deaee3-02c7-4123-b67a-78b318709c0d&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(available only with sign-in)&lt;span style=&#34;white-space: nowrap;&#34;&gt;&amp;thinsp;↗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given a graph $G$, guards are placed on vertices of $G$.&#xA;Then vertices are subject to an infinite sequence of attacks, so that each attack must be defended by a guard moving from a neighboring vertex.&#xA;The $m$-eternal domination number is the minimum number of guards such that the graph can be defended indefinitely.&#xA;In this paper we study the $m$-eternal domination number of cactus graphs, that is, graphs where each edge lies in at most two cycles, and we consider two variants of the $m$-eternal domination number: multiple guards may and may not occupy a single vertex.&#xA;We provide a new upper bound for the $m$-eternal domination number of cactus graphs, and for a subclass of cactus graphs called opuntias, where each vertex lies in at most two cycles, we prove that these two numbers are equal.&#xA;Moreover, we present a linear-time algorithm for computing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Induced Online Ramsey Number of Paths, Cycles, and Trees</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2019/induced_ornum/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An online Ramsey game is a game between Builder and Painter, alternating in turns.&#xA;They are given a graph $H$ and a graph $G$ of an infinite set of independent vertices.&#xA;In each round Builder draws an edge and Painter colors it either red or blue.&#xA;Builder wins if after some finite round there is a monochromatic copy of the graph $H$, otherwise Painter wins.&#xA;The online Ramsey number $\widetilde r(H)$ is the minimum number of rounds such that Builder can force a monochromatic copy of $H$ in $G$.&#xA;This is an analogy to the size-Ramsey number $\overline r(H)$ defined as the minimum number such that there exists graph $G$ with $\overline r(H)$ edges where for any edge two-coloring $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
