      <title>On Controlling Knockout Tournaments Without Perfect Information</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2024/probabilistic_tournament_fixing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>

      <description>Abstract Over the last decade, extensive research has been conducted on the algorithmic aspects of designing single-elimination (SE) tournaments. Addressing natural questions of algorithmic tractability, we identify key properties of input instances that enable the tournament designer to efficiently schedule the tournament in a way that maximizes the chances of a preferred player winning. Much of the prior algorithmic work on this topic focuses on the perfect (complete and deterministic) information scenario, especially in the context of fixed-parameter algorithm design.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Eulerian Strong Component Arc Deletion</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2024/eulertian_strong_components/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>
      <guid>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2024/eulertian_strong_components/</guid>
      <description>Abstract In this paper, we study the Eulerian Strong Component Arc Deletion problem, where the input is a directed multigraph and the goal is to delete the minimum number of arcs to ensure every strongly connected component of the resulting digraph is Eulerian.&#xA;This problem is a natural extension of the Directed Feedback Arc Set problem and is also known to be motivated by certain scenarios arising in the study of housing markets.</description>

      <title>Equitable Connected Partition and Structural Parameters Revisited: N-fold Beats Lenstra</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2024/equitable_connected_partition/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>
      <guid>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2024/equitable_connected_partition/</guid>
      <description>Abstract We study the Equitable Connected Partition (ECP for short) problem, where we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ together with an integer $p$, and our goal is to find a partition of $V$ into $p$ parts such that each part induces a connected sub-graph of $G$ and the size of each two parts differs by at most 1. On the one hand, the problem is known to be NP-hard in general and W[1]-hard with respect to the path-width, the feedback-vertex set, and the number of parts $p$ combined.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Network Microaggregation</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2023/microaggregation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>
      <guid>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2023/microaggregation/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Microaggregation is a classical statistical disclosure control technique which requires the input data to be partitioned into clusters while adhering to specified size constraints. We provide novel exact algorithms and lower bounds for the task of microaggregating a given network while considering both unrestricted and connected clusterings, and analyze these from the perspective of the parameterized complexity paradigm. Altogether, our results assemble a complete complexity-theoretic picture for the network microaggregation problem with respect to the most natural parameterizations of the problem, including input-specified parameters capturing the size and homogeneity of the clusters as well as the treewidth and vertex cover number of the network.</description>

      <title>On Polynomial Kernels for Traveling Salesperson Problem and its Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2022/tsp-kernels/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>
      <guid>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2022/tsp-kernels/</guid>
      <description>We investigated kernels for TSP and a related problem called Waypoint routing (WRP) &amp;ndash; a variant of TSP where one needs to only visit a subset of vertices (subset TSP) and edges have capacities for the maximum number of their traversal within the solution. Compared to the classical TSP where one may create edges that represent shortest paths, we leave the graph unchanged and analyze properties of the solution on the graph.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Kernels for Tracking Shortest Paths</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2022/tracking-paths/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>
      <guid>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2022/tracking-paths/</guid>
      <description>Tracking Shortest Paths is a task where we want to add $k$ trackers to a directed acyclic graph so that any shortest path which goes from source to the target activates a unique combination of trackers. In other words, there are no two paths that would activate the same set of trackers. One can study this problem also in variant where the paths are not necessarily shortest &amp;ndash; this is called Tracking Paths problem.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Spread of Two Secrets in Diverse Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2022/group-selection/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>
      <guid>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2022/group-selection/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Information diffusion in social networks is a well-studied concept in social choice theory. We propose the study of the diffusion of two secrets in a heterogeneous environment from the complexity perspective, that is, there are two different networks with the same set of agents (e.g., the structure of the set of followers might be different in two distinct social networks). Formally, our model combines two group identification processes for which we do have independent desiderata&amp;mdash;either constructive, where we would like a given group of agents to be exposed to a secret, or destructive, where a given group of agents should not be exposed to a secret.</description>

      <title>Constant Factor Approximation for Tracking Paths and Fault Tolerant Feedback Vertex Set</title>
      <link>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2021/tracking_paths_approximation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blazeva1 -a- fit.cvut.cz &lt;Václav Blažej&gt; (Václav Blažej)</author>
      <guid>https://vaclavblazej.github.io/pub/2021/tracking_paths_approximation/</guid>
      <description>Consider a vertex-weighted graph $G$ with a source $s$ and a target $t$. Tracking Paths requires finding a minimum weight set of vertices (trackers) such that the sequence of trackers in each path from $s$ to $t$ is unique. In this work, we derive a factor $6$-approximation algorithm for Tracking Paths in weighted graphs and a factor $4$-approximation algorithm if the input is unweighted. This is the first constant factor approximation for this problem.</description>
