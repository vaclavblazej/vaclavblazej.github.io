      <description>TUNIC&amp;thinsp;↗ is an isometric action game which also contains a good deal of puzzles. The world consists of several non-trivially interconnected locations. You progress through the game mainly by exploring, finding items, and beating bosses. While you are not given explicit directions it is usually quite clear what to do next. When some extra information is required (e.g. initially hidden control options) it is revealed through a booklet. You get pages of the booklet throughout the game and it feeds you the information in a vague manner.</description>

      <description>Rogue-lite games manifest in repeated playthroughs and gradual metagame progression. Complete mastery of the game may allow you to win a run on the first try. But for mortals there is no option other than to run many times to gain a better chance of winning. The notion of repeated play to challenge yourself to get knowledge and progression is apparent even in the name. Ring of Pain&amp;thinsp;↗ is a very good rogue-lite game with its theme embedded in every corner.</description>

      <description>The appeal of Inscription&amp;thinsp;↗ is its cool card game tied to a rogue-lite progression through the story. I found the game to be made of two major parts and, surprisingly, even though the story is interesting, I think that the game establishes a theme which later gets betrayed &amp;ndash; let me elaborate; spoilers ahead.&#xA;The game starts with you being forced into playing a card game against a dungeon mater (Leshy) who challenges you in an ascension through a map.</description>
