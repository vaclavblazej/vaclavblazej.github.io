      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TUNIC&lt;span style=&#34;white-space: nowrap;&#34;&gt;&amp;thinsp;↗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an isometric action game which also contains a good deal of puzzles.&#xA;The world consists of several non-trivially interconnected locations.&#xA;You progress through the game mainly by exploring, finding items, and beating bosses.&#xA;While you are not given explicit directions it is usually quite clear what to do next.&#xA;When some extra information is required (e.g. initially hidden control options) it is revealed through a booklet.&#xA;You get pages of the booklet throughout the game and it feeds you the information in a vague manner.&#xA;I found this feature to be surprisingly well done &amp;ndash; finding the information you need in the booklet is nice, often leading to sudden moments of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rogue-lite games manifest in repeated playthroughs and gradual metagame progression.&#xA;Complete mastery of the game may allow you to win a run on the first try.&#xA;But for mortals there is no option other than to run many times to gain a better chance of winning.&#xA;The notion of repeated play to challenge yourself to get knowledge and progression is apparent even in the name.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/998740/Ring_of_Pain/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ring of Pain&lt;span style=&#34;white-space: nowrap;&#34;&gt;&amp;thinsp;↗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a very good rogue-lite game with its theme embedded in every corner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The appeal of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Inscription&lt;span style=&#34;white-space: nowrap;&#34;&gt;&amp;thinsp;↗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is its cool card game tied to a rogue-lite progression through the story.&#xA;I found the game to be made of two major parts and, surprisingly, even though the story is interesting, I think that the game establishes a theme which later gets betrayed &amp;ndash; let me elaborate; spoilers ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game starts with you being forced into playing a card game against a dungeon mater (Leshy) who challenges you in an ascension through a map.&#xA;Throughout the journey you encounter varied places, building and upgrading your card deck.&#xA;The game becomes harder and harder and you inevitably lose which makes Leshy take a photo of you, killing you in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
