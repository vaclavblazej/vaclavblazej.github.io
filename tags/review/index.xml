      <description>Rogue-lite games manifest in repeated playthroughs and gradual metagame progression. Complete mastery of the game may allow you to win a run on the first try. But for mortals there is no option other than to run many times to gain a better chance of winning. The notion of repeated play to challenge yourself to get knowledge and progression is apparent even in the name. Ring of Pain&amp;thinsp;↗ is a very good rogue-lite game with its theme embedded in every corner.</description>

      <description>The appeal of Inscription&amp;thinsp;↗ is its cool card game tied to a rogue-lite progression through the story. I found the game to be made of two major parts and, surprisingly, even though the story is interesting, I think that the game establishes a theme which later gets betrayed &amp;ndash; let me elaborate; spoilers ahead.&#xA;The game starts with you being forced into playing a card game against a dungeon mater (Leshy) who challenges you in an ascension through a map.</description>
