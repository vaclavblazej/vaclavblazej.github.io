      <title>Online Ramsey numbers: Long versus short cycles</title>

      <description>In Online Ramsey games we have two players. One is placing edges to a graph with infinite number of vertices while the second chooses their color to be blue or red immediately. Builder (the first player) aims to force a monochromatic graph to appear. Painter (the second player) tries to postpone win of the first player as long as possible. Due to Ramsey theorem, we know that the first player eventually wins.</description>

      <title>Computing m-Eternal Domination Number of Cactus Graphs in Linear Time</title>

      <description>This paper is a culmination of a long-term effort of me and Matyáš under the supervision of Tomáš. It was initiated by Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis of Matyáš which then turned into a published paper.&#xA;The reserach concerns m-eternal domination &amp;ndash; a setting where two players, attacked and defender, play in turns. One designs the initial layout of $k$ guards on the input graph and tells how they are all moved. Each turn the attacked announces a vertex and the defender can move all guards, each by at most one edge, so that the attacked vertex now contains a guard.</description>

      <title>Efficient attack sequences in m-eternal domination</title>

      <description>We are given a graph and a number of guards to defend it against a sequence of vertex attacks. Defender controls the guards and may move every guard by at most one edge after each attack. After his move the attacked vertex must be occupied by a guard, otherwise the attacked wins. Defender wins if he has a strategy that defends the graph indefinitely.&#xA;We investigate this problem for trees where the optimal strategy was already known.</description>

      <title>Bears with Hats and Independence Polynomials</title>

      <description>Abstract Consider the following hat guessing game. A bear sits on each vertex of a graph $G$, and a demon puts on each bear a hat colored by one of $h$ colors. Each bear sees only the hat colors of his neighbors. Based on this information only, each bear has to guess $g$ colors and he guesses correctly if his hat color is included in his guesses. The bears win if at least one bear guesses correctly for any hat arrangement.</description>

      <title>On the m-eternal Domination Number of Cactus Graphs</title>

      <description>This research is a followup to Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Thesis of Jan Matyáš Křišťan (available only with sign-in)&amp;thinsp;↗.&#xA;Abstract Given a graph $G$, guards are placed on vertices of $G$. Then vertices are subject to an infinite sequence of attacks, so that each attack must be defended by a guard moving from a neighboring vertex. The $m$-eternal domination number is the minimum number of guards such that the graph can be defended indefinitely.</description>

      <title>On Induced Online Ramsey Number of Paths, Cycles, and Trees</title>

      <description>Abstract An online Ramsey game is a game between Builder and Painter, alternating in turns. They are given a graph $H$ and a graph $G$ of an infinite set of independent vertices. In each round Builder draws an edge and Painter colors it either red or blue. Builder wins if after some finite round there is a monochromatic copy of the graph $H$, otherwise Painter wins. The online Ramsey number $\widetilde r(H)$ is the minimum number of rounds such that Builder can force a monochromatic copy of $H$ in $G$.</description>
