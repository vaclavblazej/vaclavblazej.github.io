            <h1>Initialization of Parameters hierarchy website</h1>

            

        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>During the last two weeks I set up <a href="https://github.com/vaclavblazej/parameters"target="_blank">repository<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;↗</span></a> which generates <a href="https://vaclavblazej.github.io/parameters/"target="_blank">website<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;↗</span></a> about parameterized complexity.
More specifically, it depicts hierarchy of various parameters.
This project was on my mind for a while and wasn&rsquo;t sure how to do it, but then realized it will be quite easy to do with a static website.
I use static web generator for my homepage and understand it well enough to setup any other site.</p>
<p>Originally, the data was modelled via system that I tried to develop in the past.
There are no nice tools to manage such data, so that was a huge drawback about this approach.
From a software developer viewpoint it may be natural to save the data in a database, but this comes with a cost of managing the database and migrating whenever the scheme is updated.
I don&rsquo;t have time for that!
So the final data representation is as a python source code.
This can be easily imported to other python code to generate the site or fill a database.
It is easy to migrate through text replacements as everything is in text files (use vim btw).
It allows people to participate, as it is relatively easy to raise a pull request with a source code change.</p>
<p>Having a single underlying representation is important to allow exports to various formats.
The plan is to have static entries, interactive mode, and a PDF.</p>
<p>The depicted boxes represent series of graph classes each consisting of graph with upper bounded value of the mentioned parameter.
So <em>treewidth</em> means all graphs with treewidth at most T where T is some integer.
An arrow represents inclusions of these graph classes, more precisely, any class of bounded treewidth T is contained in a class of bounded cliquewidth $f(T)$ where $f$ is computable function.
Plan is to also show when $f$ is polynomial or exponential, which seems to be of interest to the field.</p>
<p>A different issue with any such diagram is whether it is correct, best possible, and complete.
Correctness will hopefully be reached with having references to everything together with people reporting issues.
Depicting an inclusion as best possible (among depicted parameters) can be done with a different arrow, that is not the issue.
Such inclusion should also come with a proof of optimality &ndash; a simple way to do this is to show a classical graph class has upper bounded one parameter and unbounded another parameter.
This gives a natural demand for a view that depicts for each graph class whether it is bounded or unbounded for each parameter in the hierarchy.
Completeness is almost impossible, but we can aim to have as many useful parameters as possible.
It is important to define what properties should a parameter have to be included in the picture &ndash; I believe that it has to be one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>natural</em> &ndash; trivial definition, understandable</li>
<li><em>useful</em> &ndash; may have hard definition but we can solve many problems that could not be easily solved for less restrictive parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>We may define meta parameters to bring generalizations for several other parameters.
Such parameters could be simply defined as union of the other parameters so these should be shown to posses one of the above properties.</p>
<p>This hierarchy bring a natural comparison to <a href="https://www.graphclasses.org/"target="_blank">ISGCI<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;↗</span></a> &ndash; a project which holds information about graph inclusions and tractability of problems for graph classes.
We can draw a comparison to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISGCI holds graph classes; we have &ldquo;sequences&rdquo; of classes</li>
<li>classes relate with inclusions; sequences have inclusions but with a changed parameter</li>
<li>non-inclusion is witnessed with a counterexample graph; sequence non-inclusion is witnessed with a counterexample graph class</li>
</ul>
<p>A natural question is now &ldquo;where&rdquo; is the graph class included in the bounded parameter class?
E.g. linear-forests are included in pathwidth 1 graphs.
As bounded parameter graph classes are downward-closed it implies that all pathwidth $\ge 1$ graphs classes include paths.
To show paths are not included at all, we have to show that paths include a sequence of graphs that contradict this inclusion.
E.g. a path has logarithmic treedepth so class of paths have unbounded treedepth.</p>
<p>Bounded-parameter graph classes may form infinite hierarchy, e.g. $d$-path vertex cover is a class that depends on the value of $d$.
2-path vertex cover is simply the vertex cover.
3-path vertex cover is the same as distance to independent edge.
Simply said, $d$-path vertex cover is distance to graphs with paths at most $d-1$.
Clearly, there is an inclusion of 2-PVC in 3-PVC, and so on.
This phenomenon is similar to what happens to the graph classes with respect to the parameter, however, the parameter has a special role in characterizing the complexity of the problem.
BUT if we care just about inclusions, then complexity of the problem is irrelevant and we may be just interested whether 3-PVC with solution size 6 is included in 9-PVC with solution size 4.
How to show this will hopefully become clearer in the future.</p>
<p>Once we put back the requirement to investigate problems within this hierarchy it is natural to try P vs NP-hardness for each fixed-parameter class.
This gives us XP and para-NP classes, respectively.
XP is not great because the polynomial can grow hugely dependent on the parameter, so we prefer to have the polynomial independent on the parameter &ndash; this gives us FPT complexity class.
Right now, there is no plan to add complexity classes to the database &ndash; it may be possible to display complexities for a researched problem in the future, but having also a database of problems and their solutions would step on the field of ISGCI, and perhaps then it would be natural to consider joining them.</p>
